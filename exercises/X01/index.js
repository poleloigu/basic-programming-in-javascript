/**
 * This is an array of objects of people who would like to go to an event.
 * Make an array of people attending an event, both first name and last name
 * and print their last and first name into console.
 *
 * Extra:
 * #1 The event they would like to go to is an 21+ event.
 * So everyone aged less than 21 cannot get inside.
 *
 * #2 Print out all males or females that went to the 21+ event.
 *
 * #3 For current safety reasons we must randomly give every person a 50% chance of getting in.
 *
 * #4 If a persons first or last name starts with C, G, F, L, X or W they sadly cannot come in to the event.
 * Write the alert/console message for which letter they cannot be admitted for.
